  ## 🔍 Should I Buy This Property?
  **Short Answer:** 🟡 Maybe — only if zoning and rental numbers check out.

  ## ✅ Pros
  - Room rental income covers 85% of costs
  - Strong refi potential if ADU is legal

  ## ❌ Cons
  - High rehab + permit risk
  - DSCR success depends on low vacancy

  ## 🛠 Checklist
  - [ ] $30K reserves
  - [ ] Confirm zoning
  - [ ] Refi model with PMI removed

  ## Verdict: 🟡 YELLOW LIGHT
  “You’d live here for about $500/mo if everything works, but have backup if not.”
