House Hack OS

"Build with agents. Think with reason. Decide with confidence."

House Hack OS is a multi-agent reasoning engine that simulates real estate investment decisions. Its first application focuses on live-in builders (house hackers) using FHA financing with DSCR refinance goals.

This isn’t just a real estate model—it’s a general-purpose cognitive architecture for decision-making. It combines structured logic, adversarial stress tests, and probabilistic simulations into one modular pipeline.

Status: Active WIP / Philosophy in Motion

This is a thinking system under construction, not a polished product. We're translating natural-language intelligence (prompts, dialogue, logic trees) into deterministic code (Python, YAML, JSON).

The core logic works. We're now hardening the architecture for real-world use and broader domains.

Vision

To democratize institutional-grade decision tools by building a programmable reasoning engine:

    For first-time investors with questions

    For analysts who want structure, not hype

    For anyone who thinks in "what-ifs" and "why-nots"

This started as a house hacking tool—but it’s evolving into a new way to code decisions.

System Overview

House Hack OS runs a modular, multi-phase decision pipeline:

    Data Aggregation + Fact-Checking

        GeminiAgent: Pulls market data (price, rents, taxes, comps).

        ClaudeFactChecker: Scrubs it for realism, fills missing values, flags edge cases.

    Greenlight Gate: Tiered Screening Logic

        GreenlightGateEvaluation: Applies profile filters (e.g., breakeven, tax limits).

        CalculateTierScore: Uses tier-weighted logic to score.

        DetermineVerdict: Returns Greenlight / Yellow / Red verdict.

    Adversarial Philosophy Engine

        RunAdversarialAgents: Activates Socrates (assumptions), Murphy (failures), Bayes (probability), and Machiavelli (bias).

        ScoreConfidenceFromStressTest: Produces a fragility-based confidence score.

    Monte Carlo Simulation (Phase 3)

        RunMonteCarlo: Simulates thousands of timelines for cash flow, refinance odds, downside traps, and bailouts.

        Powered by investor profiles and scenario trees.

    Conditional Memo + Execution Firewall

        CreateConditionalMemo: Summarizes outcome, adds blockers if needed.

        FinalDecisionGate: Blocks or greenlights the investment pipeline based on conditions.

Feedback Loop (Coming Soon)

    LearnFromOutcome: Uses outcome data to retrain weights, priors, and confidence scores.

    Goal: Become a learning system, not just a reasoning engine.

Roadmap

    Modular agent design

    Confidence engine + tier scoring

    Monte Carlo engine buildout (Phase 3)

    LLM narrators for explainability

    FastAPI or N8N wrapper for real-time access

    Transition to general-purpose decision-os library

    "Philosophy-as-a-Feature" agent marketplace

Philosophy of Use

This system emerged from a simple belief:

"LLMs aren’t just assistants—they’re thinkers. We just needed a way to organize the thinking."

Dual Stack Approach:

    Natural Language + YAML -> For prototyping, synthesis, and human reasoning

    Python + JSON -> For execution, repeatability, and scaling

Use what’s best for the task. Keep both layers.

Contributing

This project welcomes:

    Feedback on design, logic, and structure

    Contributions to agents, prompts, and simulation logic

    Philosophers, investors, and devs alike

Everything starts from structured thought.

Who This Is For

    First-time house hackers

    FHA investors seeking DSCR exits

    Prompt engineers and Python tinkerers

    Decision theorists and LLM agentsmiths

Why It's Worth Building (Even in Early Stages)

You’re watching the emergence of a new programming paradigm:

    Prompts as functions

    Philosophers as agents

    YAML as config + contract

    Reasoning as infrastructure

This repo is the blueprint.

Next Steps

Want to try it? Clone it, run main.py, load a profile + property, and simulate.
Need help? Start with profiles/example.yaml and run a single agent first.
